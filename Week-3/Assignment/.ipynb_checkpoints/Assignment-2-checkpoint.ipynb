    "The [Messier Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier first back in 1774. The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies. Messier objects are extremely popular targets for amateur astronomers. Back on campus, we organised a lot of Messier Marathons in which you would have to identify and locate as many Messiers in a fixed time. The following question is inspired by **SnT Code** - probably the most popular and fun event during your stay on campus. Below is a picture of [M42 (Orion Nebula)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula) for absolutely no reason. \n",

    "> 1. The mean of Right Ascension and Declination can be approximated as the actual location of the Globular Cluster.\n",

    "> 3. Employ the crossmatching techniques that you learnt to find out the nearest Messier to your target cluster. You may take the offset radius to be 30 arcsec. \n",
